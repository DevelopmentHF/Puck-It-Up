## Overview

`Puck-It-Up` is made by two students from the University of Melbourne, aiming to learn the basics of mobile development. <br>

The project is written in `Lua`, using the `Solar2d` framework. <br>

It is currently a work in progress, and aims to set it itself apart from other similar games by including **powerups** on the playing field. <br>
